Some time ago, Ed Dutton and I published a study showing that in the USA, being a member of the Mormon club seems to protect one against having a dysgenic fertility pattern for intelligence. In plain language, in the total population, more intelligent people have somewhat fewer children on average (this varies by country). However, this negative correlation is absent or maybe even reversed (positive) among Mormons. Visually:

Due to the small numbers of Mormons, and the need for complex cohort and age controls, the exact slope of fertility ~ intelligence for the Mormons was hard to estimate precisely, hence the big confidence interval above.



The Mormon study was based on the General Social Survey (GSS), a large American dataset. There were some problems with this. First, the intelligence measurement is poor to mediocre, being the 10-item Wordsum vocabulary test. Second, religiousness was not measured as a continuous construct, but by self-reported membership of different religions or their subdivisions (denominations). Thus, the power is much reduced as mere membership is a proxy of the more relevant trait of general religiousness, or perhaps some more specific religion related traits.

In the new study, we sought to remedy both of these issues:

* Dutton, E., & Kirkegaard, E. O. W. (2024). Does Conservative Religiousness Promote Selection for Intelligence? An Analysis of the Vietnam Experience Study. Mankind Quarterly, 64(3), Article 6. https://doi.org/10.46469/mq.2024.64.3.6

  `Previous research has indicated that religiousness may moderate the negative effect of intelligence on fertility which is found in modern populations. We studied this question using the Vietnam Experience Study, a public dataset of 4,462 American Vietnam-era veterans. In line with prior research, we found that, net of controls, intelligence predicted lower fertility, β =-0.06 (p = .003), and religiousness predicted higher fertility β = 0.21 (p < .001). The expected interaction, intelligence * religiousness, was also found (β = 0.06 (p = .002). The results show that above average religiousness is associated with a neutral or positive fertility pattern regarding intelligence, while average or below average religiousness is associated with a negative fertility pattern. The results held when the White subsample was analyzed separately (intelligence · religiousness β = 0.09 p < .001). Finally, the negative relationship between intelligence and fertility seen in the dataset showed a strong Jensen Effect in the expected direction (n = 19 tests, r = −.73).`

So, yes, it is yet another study based on the ever relevant Vietnam Experience Study dataset (which is public thanks to our efforts). In the dataset, subjects answered more than 550 yes/no questions from the MMPI-2 (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory). This is perhaps the weirdest test of mental illness since the questions don’t have any overall theme, except that they serve to distinguish mental hospital inhabitants from ordinary people (in the 1940s). Consequently, it features very varied questions, some of which measure religiousness. We used 12 of these questions to form a general religiousness scale:
