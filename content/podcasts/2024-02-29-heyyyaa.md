Gestalt Therapy emphasizes personal responsibility and focuses on the individual's experience in the present moment, the therapist-client relationship, the environmental and social contexts of a person's life, and the self-regulating adjustments people make as a result of their overall situation. It integrates the body and mind factors, allowing clients to become more self-aware and to understand the blockages that may hinder their personal growth and development.
