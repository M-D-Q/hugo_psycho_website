foreword: Europeans became a high-IQ population through an evolutionary
  trajectory that began with the adoption of farming and continued because of
  the cognitive demands of social complexity. Much of the upward trend in
  cognitive ability has occurred since medieval times.

**H**uman evolution did not end in the Paleolithic. It continued and even accelerated along different trajectories in different populations and for different traits (Cochran and Harpending, 2009; Hawks et al., 2007; Rinaldi, 2017).



One trait is cognitive ability — the ability to process information, recognize patterns, and solve problems. Among those humans who entered Europe, mean cognitive ability would increase to such a degree that the continent is today one of the world’s two “IQ plateaus.” When did that increase happen? During the last ice age? Or more recently?



A recent increase is postulated by Gregory Clark (2007; 2009; 2023), who has studied the demographic history of England. As the English middle class grew in size from the twelfth century onward, its lineages contributed more and more to the country’s gene pool. The result was a mental and behavioral shift toward “middle class” qualities of mind and behaviour — not only higher cognitive ability but also lower time preference, greater impulse control, and less willingness to settle disputes through violence.



![All three measures of cognitive ability show the same pattern over time. In this study, the upward trend is more continuous and consequently less steep (Piffer and Kirkegaard, 2024).](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F984133df-404f-4b0a-a94a-2228d001e1af_555x513.png "Regional trends")





### Alleles associated with socioeconomic status

The researchers also looked at changes over time in alleles associated with socioeconomic status, as ascertained in contemporary British individuals. Alleles associated with higher status became more frequent from the end of the ice age to around 2500 years ago, after which there was no further change.  There was likewise no change between medieval and contemporary English genomes.



This is not what Clark would predict. He argued that the late-medieval/post-medieval growth of the middle class favored not only alleles associated with higher cognitive ability but also those associated with “middle class values,” like lower time preference and greater impulse control. Perhaps higher socioeconomic status is today determined by a different package of mental and behavioral traits.



### Remaining questions

##### Cognitive evolution and the transition to farming

Were native Europeans selected for higher cognitive ability when hunting and gathering gave way to farming? Or were they simply replaced by Middle Eastern farmers moving into Europe from Anatolia? Piffer and Kirkegaard argue for the latter scenario:



> *Hunter-gatherer ancestry (particularly V2 or WHG) was negatively associated with EA3, EA4 and IQ in the regression models (Supplementary Tables S1-S3) even after accounting for Years BP (β=-0.314, -0.4, -0.249), suggesting that the increase in cognitive capacity was not solely driven by the Neolithic revolution but was partly mediated by admixture with the immigrants that accompanied it. Anatolian Neolithic farmers who intermixed with native HGs contributed between approximately 40% and 98% of Neolithic European ancestry (Piffer and Kirkegaard, 2024)*

The estimate of 40 to 98% replacement of European hunter-gatherers by Anatolian farmers should be viewed with caution. It is based on the assumption that demographic replacement explains all of the genetic change across the time boundary between hunter-gatherers and farmers. In reality, some of it was due to:
